IMGResponsive
=============
A jQuery plugin for responsive inline images. This plugin allows you to swap out an image's src attribute at developer-defined breakpoints, or if no breakpoint is specified, it will simply swap out retina images for non-retina.  It utilizes a file-naming convention, which eliminates the need for overly-complex inline attribute values.  The breakpoint detection script used is jRespond, found at https://github.com/ten1seven/jRespond.
