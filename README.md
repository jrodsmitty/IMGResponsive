IMGResponsive
=============

jQuery plugin for responsive inline images. This plugin allows you to swap out an image's src attribute at developer-defined breakpoints.  It utilizes a file-naming convention that correlates to the breakpoints, which limits the need for lots of complex inline attribute values.  The breakpoint detection script used is jRespond, found at https://github.com/ten1seven/jRespond.
